## How to contribute to PinFlux

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in PinFlux**, and instead to refer to our [support page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/molpfdakehebpkaecfdpndakphebjjpp/support).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Yedidya10/chatgpt_pinChats/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Yedidya10/chatgpt_pinChats/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to PinFlux]() guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of PinFlux will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your Ideas in the [Ideas discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/Yedidya10/chatgpt_pinChats/discussions/new?category=ideas).

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have positive feedback from the community about your idea. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use Ruby on PinFlux in the [support page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/molpfdakehebpkaecfdpndakphebjjpp/support).
